About
-----

This is the UKBB genetic correlation browser.  It consists of two
stateful sets deployed in the ukbb-rg namespace:

 - ukbb-rg-static, which runs nginx and serves static content, and
 - ukbb-rg-browser, which runs a R Shiny server

Updating
--------

The ukbb-rg browser, beyond the contents of this directory, depends on
four sets of files:

 - docs
 - site_libs
 - Rdata_outputs
 - app

app consists of two files:

 - app/app.R
 - app/www/rainbowvis.js

which must be copied into ./app in this directory before running "make deploy"
to update the images. You can find these files [in Duncan's GitHub repository at
`/r2_browser`](https://github.com/astheeggeggs/UKBB_ldsc_r2/tree/master/r2_browser).

The other three sets of files should already be present on the persistent disks
associated with the stateful set. If they are not, you can upload them with
`make update-ukbb-rg-browser-files` and `make
update-ukbb-rg-static-files`. These make targets only work for stateful sets of
size one.
