About
-----

This is the UKBB genetic correlation browser.  It consists of two
stateful sets deployed in the ukbb-rg namespace:

 - ukbb-rg-static, which runs nginx and serves static content, and
 - ukbb-rg-browser, which runs a R Shiny server

Updating
--------

The ukbb-rg browser, beyond the contents of this directory, depends on
four sets of files:

 - docs
 - site_libs
 - Rdata_outputs
 - app

app consists of two files:

 - app/app.R
 - app/www/rainbowvis.js

which must be copied into ./app in this directory before running "make
deploy" to update the images.

The contents of docs and site_libs must be copied (using kubectl cp,
for example) into ukbb-rg/ukbb-rg-static:/ukbb-rg-static.  So,

 - docs/rg_summary_102.html => /ukbb-rg-static/rg_summary_102.html, and
 - site_libs => /ukbb-rg-static/site_libs.

Rdata_outputs must be copied into
ukbb-rg/ukbb-rg-browser:/ukbb-rg-browser.

Currently, this is done manually with possible downtime.
