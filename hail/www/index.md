# Hail

Hail is an open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis library with additional data types and methods for working with genomic data.

Hail is built to scale and has first-class support for multi-dimensional structured data, like the genomic data in a genome-wide association study (GWAS).

Hail's backend is implemented in Python, Scala, Java, and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html).
