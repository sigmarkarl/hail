This is the API documentation for Batch, and provides detailed information
on the Python programming interface.

Use ``import hailtop.batch`` to access this functionality.


.. currentmodule:: hailtop.batch


Batches
~~~~~~~

A :class:`.Batch` is an object that represents the set of jobs to run
and the order or dependencies between the jobs. Each :class:`.Job` has bash commands
to execute, a docker container in which to execute them, and settings for storage,
memory, and CPU.

    batch.Batch
    job.Job


Resources
~~~~~~~~~

A :class:`.Resource` is an abstract class that represents files in a :class:`.Batch` and
has two subtypes: :class:`.ResourceFile` and :class:`.ResourceGroup`.

A single file is represented by a :class:`.ResourceFile` which has two subtypes:
:class:`.InputResourceFile` and :class:`.JobResourceFile`. An InputResourceFile is used
to specify files that are inputs to a :class:`.Batch`. These files are not generated as outputs from a
:class:`.Job`. Likewise, a JobResourceFile is a file that is produced by a job. JobResourceFiles
generated by one job can be used in subsequent job, creating a dependency between the jobs.

A :class:`.ResourceGroup` represents a collection of files that should be treated as one unit. All files
share a common root, but each file has its own extension.

    resource.Resource
    resource.ResourceFile
    resource.InputResourceFile
    resource.JobResourceFile
    resource.ResourceGroup


Backends
~~~~~~~~

A :class:`.Backend` is an abstract class that can execute a :class:`.Batch`. Currently,
there are two types of backends: :class:`.LocalBackend` and :class:`.ServiceBackend`. The
local backend executes a batch on your local computer by running a shell script. The service
backend executes a batch on Google Compute Engine VMs operated by the Hail team
(:ref:`Batch Service <sec-service>`). You can access the UI for the Batch Service
at `<https://batch.hail.is>`__.
